mpf-presenter
=============

Professional presentation software, similar to PowerPoint or Keynote, but more flexible for professional presentations to large audiences.

mpf-presenter is based on the media controller of the Mission Pinball Framework (mpf).

The mpf-presenter project has not been started yet, but we're using this readme file to create a list of ideas

Rationale
---------

In their day jobs, the creators of the Mission Pinball Framework are professional presenters who often present to large audiences. We've been frustrated with the limitations of existing presentation software such as PowerPoint and Keynote as they're more geared towards casual users and smaller groups.

Features
--------

* Highly customizable presenter display, including multiple presenter displays
  with different settings
* Shortcuts to jump ahead, back
* Any type of widget (you can code your own), including count-downs, etc.
